In an online session at DSC DACH 2025, we present an introduction to why we use Dagster for data orchestration at Magenta Telekom and provide a hands-on getting started tutorial. If you are new to Dagster or considering it for your data engineering workflows, this session covers what I teach new team members at Magenta Telekom to get them up to speed.
