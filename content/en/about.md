I'm a professional data engineer living in Vienna, Austria, working for Magenta Telekom as a Data Platform Engineer.

Here you can find a list of tools, frameworks, and resources with reasoning for why I like and use them as a professional data engineer. 

### Learning Resources

#### [CMU Database Group](https://www.youtube.com/@CMUDatabaseGroup)
YouTube channel from Professor [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~apavlo/). This is the first course that actually helped me in my day-to-day job as a data engineer. I would recommend first watching Intro to Databases, then the Advanced Database course, and finally all the seminars and guest lectures for the latest information and system understanding. There is a lot of material—I've been following it since 2021. I recommend starting with the new semester and watching videos as they're released.

#### [Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8)
This changed my mind about teaching and learning math and was a point where I understood why we need math to solve real problems. He teaches very simply, almost making you feel like you're figuring it out together.

### Frameworks and Tools I Use Every Day

#### [Dagster](https://dagster.io/)
Data orchestration platform - Dagster changed the way of modeling data flow from task-centric towards a more natural asset-centric approach.

#### [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)
Data transformation tool

#### [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)
Google's data warehouse - I like that their pricing model pushes you to think about the most important part of working with data and this is how to early prune as much data as possible.

#### [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
DevOps platform

#### [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
AI assistant by Anthropic 

### Things I'm Interested In But Not Using Day to Day Yet

#### [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
Embeddable analytical database - First of its kind to bring the depths of analytical databases into a single process. A great community and great things are ahead for DuckDB.

#### [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/)
Open data lake and catalog format - It's a great idea to converge toward known patterns while addressing modern needs. I feel really excited about the future of the project.

#### [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
Systems programming language - No pointers going to nirvana (my professor at university's quote) due to very simple compiler rules forcing you to define who is responsible for working with a memory block.
