I'm a professional data engineer living in Vienna, Austria, working for Magenta Telekom.

Here you can find a list of tools, frameworks, and resources with reasoning for why I like and use them as a professional data engineer and for personal projects.

### Learning Resources
- [CMU Database Group](https://www.youtube.com/@CMUDatabaseGroup) YouTube channel from Professor [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~apavlo/). This is the first course that actually helped me in my day-to-day job as a data engineer. I would recommend first watching Intro to Databases, then the Advanced Database course, and finally all the seminars and guest lectures for the latest information and system understanding. There is a lot of material—I've been following it since 2021. I recommend starting with the new semester and watching videos as they're released.

### Frameworks and Tools I Use Every Day
- [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) - Data orchestration platform
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) - Data transformation tool
- [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) - Google's data warehouse
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - DevOps platform
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) - AI assistant by Anthropic

### Things I'm Interested In But Not Using Day to Day Yet
- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) - Embeddable analytical database
- [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/) - Open data lake and catalog format 
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Systems programming language
