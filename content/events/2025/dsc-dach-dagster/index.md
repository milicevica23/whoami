In a online session at DSC DACH 2025, we present an introduction to why we use Dagster for data orchestration at Magenta Telekom and also do a getting started hands on tutorial. If you are new to Dagster or considering it for your data engineering workflows, this session is what I teach new team members at Magenta Telekom to get them up to speed.
